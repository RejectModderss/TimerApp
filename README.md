# TimerApp

TimerApp is a simple timer application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to set a countdown timer, switch between 24-hour and 12-hour formats, and plays an alarm sound when the timer reaches zero.

## Features

- Set a countdown timer in minutes.
- Switch between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats.
- Pause, resume, and stop the timer.
- Visual representation of hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Alarm sound notification upon timer completion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python).

### Installation
Only thing you need is pygame use this command to install it! `pip install pygame`

### Stopping the Alarm Sound

If you wish to stop the alarm sound manually or encounter any issues with the automatic stop, you can use the "Stop Timer" button. Clicking this button will halt the alarm sound and reset the timer, allowing you to start a new timer if needed.

### Customizing the Alarm Sound

The default alarm sound is [Samsung Alarm](https://www.zedge.net/ringtone/0d3a6b29-7272-40dd-b9ff-71783a1c7871). If you'd like to customize the alarm sound, you can replace the `samsung_alarm.mp3` file in the project directory with your preferred sound file. Make sure the new file is in the MP3 format for compatibility.


### Usage
1. Enter the desired timer duration in minutes.
2. Click the "Start Timer" button.
3. Optionally, switch between 24-hour and 12-hour formats using the "Switch Format" button.
4. Stop the timer when needed.
5. An alarm sound will play when the timer reaches zero.

### Report Bugs
If you honestly want to report a bug you find in this you can by adding me on discord, my discord is `rejectmodders`, but thats completely up to you, its in python, you could probably fix the bugs yourself, but this was a little project I did for fun to be honest.
